    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's a detailed step by step on how to cook jollof rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, blend the bell peppers, plum tomatoes, scotch bonnet, and brown onion.</li>
        <li>Place a pot on heat, add oil into the pot, then add in sliced onions. Sautee the onions till they are fragrant and translucent. This should take about 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Next, add in the tomato puree/tomato paste. Fry for 5-10 minutes till reduced in quantity and doesn't taste tart.</li>
        <li>Add in the blended peppers, curry powder, dried thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves, and salt. Fry till it is dark red and no longer raw. It will be reduced in quantity, thick and the oil floats to the top of the sauce. This takes about 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add in the chicken broth, and boiling water. Stir, add in the washed rice. Cover the pot tightly and cook the rice on low heat till it's almost tender. (About 25 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the remaining sliced red onion, sliced tomato, and butter.</li>
        <li> Cover the pot and continue to steam the rice till it's tender.</li>
        <li>Stir the rice and take it off the heat.</li>

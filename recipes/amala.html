    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Big Bunch Ewedu Leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups Water</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon locust beans</li>
        <li>1 Heaped tablespoon ground crayfish</li>
        <li>1 Bouillon cube</li>
        <li>Salt </li>
        <li>yam flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:Amala</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water in a pot and allow to get hot.</li>
        <li>Add the yam flour into it and stir continuously using a wooden stick to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Add extra yam flour if watery or add some water if it’s too strong (just like the way your 
            make your semovita).</li>
        <li>Turn the yam flour very well, then add a bit of water, cover and allow to cook for about 10mins.</li>
        <li>Wrap it up in nylon.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps:Ewedu</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick your Ewedu leaves, make sure you don’t pick the stalk/stem along with it.</li>
        <li>Wash the leaves thoroughly to rid it of dirt. Pour the water into a medium size pan, place on a bob on medium heat, bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>If you’re using a broom (Ijabe), use the broom to pound the leaves.</li>
        <li>If you’re using a blender, take the Ewedu off the heat and leave to cool for a bit…don’t switch the heat off.</li>
        <li>Add the Ewedu into a blender along with the Iru, make sure you don’t add all the water, just 1/2 a cup should do. Too much water will affect the viscosity of your Ewedu.</li>
        <li>Using the pulse function, pulse a few times till you get a semi-purée consistency.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Ewedu back into the pan, add the ground crayfish, bouillon cube and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat and let it simmer with the residual heat for 3 minutes….stir occasionally to prevent burning. Do not over cook or the Ewedu will go brown.</li>
    </ol>
